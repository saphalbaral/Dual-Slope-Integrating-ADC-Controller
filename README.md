A binary counter, frequency divider, output register, and FSM design were used to create a controller on a FPGA to operate a TC514 dual-slope integrating ADC, sequencing auto-zero, integrate, deintegrate, and reset phases.
PLEASE NOTE:
- File names ending with _TB are testbenches to test each entity.
- The TC514fsm.vhd file contains the entire structural architecture of the controller.
- The tc514cntrl_TB was used to test the FSM and entire controller.
